3. **Deleting an Item**: Swipe left on an item to delete it from the list.
4. **Fetching Items**: The app automatically fetches and displays all items from the backend when launched.

## Backend Setup

The Shopping List App uses Firebase as its backend. To set up the backend, follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Set up a Firestore database within your Firebase project.
3. Configure your app to use Firebase by adding the `google-services.json` file to the project.

## HTTP Requests

The app uses the `http` package to send requests to the backend. Here are the key HTTP operations:

1. **POST Request**: Sending new items to the backend.
2. **GET Request**: Fetching all items from the backend.
3. **DELETE Request**: Removing items from the backend.

## Error Handling

The app includes robust error handling mechanisms to manage different error scenarios:

- Display error messages for network failures.
- Handle the "No Data" case gracefully.
- Use the `FutureBuilder` widget to manage asynchronous operations and loading states.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential improvements for the Shopping List App:

- Add user authentication to manage individual shopping lists.
- Implement sorting and filtering options for the items.
- Allow users to share their shopping lists with others.
